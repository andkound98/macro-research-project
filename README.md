# The Dynamic Consequences of Technology and Discount Factor Shocks in Medium-Scale RANK vs TANK Models

By the end of January, I will collect in this repository everything relevant to the project I submit in January 2023 for the Research Module  "Macroeconomics and Public Economics" in the Economics Master's programme at the University of Bonn.

## run_models.py
This file loads the files where the models are stored, finds the steady state of the models and solves as well as plots the dynamcis of the models following various shocks.
